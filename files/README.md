# PDFs Folder

Place your PDF/DOCX/PPTX files in this folder to use them with the chatbot.

## How to Use

1. Copy your document files into this `files` folder
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app/main.py`
3. In the sidebar, select a document from the dropdown
4. Click "Load File" to load it as context
5. Start chatting - the LLM will use the document content to answer your questions

## Example

If you place a file called `research_paper.pdf` in this folder, it will appear in the document selection dropdown menu (on the side) in the app.
